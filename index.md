## About Me

I am a 2nd-year Master student at UCLA.

I am currently a member of ARC, an AIGC Research Collaboration based off several labs to pursue targeted topics in Multimodal Language Agents, advised by [Ruochen Wang](https://ruocwang.github.io/) and Prof. [Cho-Jui Hsieh](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/). My research currently focuses on Attacks on Large Language Models. Prior to the era of LLM, I worked on object detection and visual interpretations. Besides research, I am also interested in entrepreneurial opportunities.

I obtained my B.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Technical University of Munich. During this period, I did my thesis about object detection at [fortiss](https://www.fortiss.org/), a research institute of the Free State of Bavaria for software-intensive systems.
